                <strong>Urban Design &amp; Planning 200: Introduction to Urbanization</strong>
                <br>Spring Quarter
                <br><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/udp200_syllabus.pdf">Most recent syllabus</a>
                <br>This course introduces you to cities. What are cities?  Where do they come from?  How do they work? And, crucially, how can cities be better than they are today? In investigating these questions, we will explore the spatial, economic, cultural, political, and social aspects of cities, as well as the relations among them. We will also examine case studies drawn from both the global North and South that will help us see how the ideas we explore are being worked out in actual practice.

                <br><strong>Community, Environment, and Planning 301: The Idea of Community</strong>
                <br>Fall Quarter
                <br><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/cep301_syllabus.pdf">Most recent syllabus</a>
                <br>In this course, we read classics that examine the idea of community: Plato's <em>Republic</em>, Aristotle's <em>Politics</em>, Hobbes' <em>Leviathan</em>, Locke's <em>Second Treatise</em>, Rousseau's <em>Social Contract</em>, and selected works by Marx and Bakunin, all in an effort to understand some of the main debates on what communities are, and what they should be.

                <br><strong>Community, Environment, and Planning 461: Ethics and Identity</strong>
                <br>Winter Quarter

                <br>Wittgenstein once said, "If a [person] could write a book on Ethics which really was a book on Ethics, this book would, with an explosion, destroy all the other books in the world." Maybe no one has quite done that yet, but a few have come close, people like Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hume, Mill, Kant, and Nietzsche. In this course we try to digest those classics, and then near the end we explore some of their distinct limitations by investigating work in feminist ethics.

                <br><strong>Urban Design &amp; Planning 592: Planning Theory</strong>
                <br>Winter Quarter
                <br><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/udp592_syllabus.pdf">Most recent syllabus</a>
                <br>Planning theory concerns itself with the ideas of planning. Given that every plan is underlain, and even driven by, ideas, it is essential for all planners to be critically literate in planning theory.  Being literate involves seriously examining and understanding the arguments of important theorists.  Being critical means subjecting those arguments to sustained scrutiny, both from your own perspective, and from the perspectives of other planning theorists.  The principal goal of this course is to develop your critical literacy in planning theory.

                <br><strong>Urban Design &amp; Planning 567: Democracy, Citizenship, and Participation in the City</strong>
                <br>This course is not currently being taught, but will return again in the future.
                <br><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/udp567_syllabus.pdf">Most recent syllabus</a>
                <br>This course explores democracy and the city.  More specifically, it examines the decisions that shape the geography of the city.  Think of any project or process that is reshaping the spatial and social relations in a given city.  How are the decisions being made?  How democratic are those decisions?  How democratic should they be?  How can they be made more democratically?  In general, what role should "the public" or "the people" play in determining the future of the city?
